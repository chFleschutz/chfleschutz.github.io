## Overview

**Eternal Flame** was developed for the **Ak Gaming Game Jam #2** at my university and is a third-person parkour adventure game set in a frozen underworld. The player must rekindle the eternal flame to restore hellâ€™s former glory by navigating through obstacles and evading enemies along the way.

The game was build in Unreal Engine 5 and uses its motion matching system to create fluid movement animations as the player runs, climbs and jumps across the underworld.

If you want to play the game for yourself, it is available for download on itch.io:
