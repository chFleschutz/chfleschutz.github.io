## Overview

This project is a collection of classic AI for Games algorithms, implemented in **C++** and visualized with **Qt**. It was developed during the **AI for Games 2** lecture and demonstrates several techniques used in navigation, decision-making and learning for AI game agents.

Features:
- **Flowfield Pathfinding:** Efficient movement of large groups of agents
- **Influence Maps:** Spatial reasoning for tactical decision making
- **Hillclimbing:** Estimating local maxima in search problems
- **R-Q Learning:** Reinforcement learning for action optimization
- **Ballistic Prediction:** Analysis of projectile trajectories
