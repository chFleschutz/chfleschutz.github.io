## Overview

**Raspberry** is a top‑down adventure game set in a steampunk world which is consumed by deadly S.T.E.A.M. It was developed for the **Ak Gaming Game Jam #1** at my university in collaboration with another student. 

The player can only move by dashing, with each dash costing energy that must be refilled through energy-pickups. Additional powerups enhance the dash ability to creating a fast‑paced, resource‑management challenge.
